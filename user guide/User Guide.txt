a - move left
s - move backwards
d - move right

q - rotate camera left
e - rotate camera right

Scene Controls:
(rooms are numbered as seen in the default scene layout.png)

1 - begin simulation in ramp room
2 - begin simulation in sphere collision room
3 - begin simulation in elasticity room
4 - begin simulation in rotational momentum room

Do not use the numpad keys

Changing Scene variables:
- locate "MainScene.txt" under the SceneData folder
